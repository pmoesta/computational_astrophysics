# Course Overview

This is the A&A MSc course on Computational Astrophysics.

## Goals

### Understanding algorithms

The main goal of this class is to understand how the core numerical
methods that we use to solve problems in astrophysics work.  Today,
you can find libraries that implement much of these algorithms for us,
with nice, easy-to-use interfaces.  For example, the [SciPy
library](https://scipy.org/) for python.

However, before we use a "black box" implementation of a method, we
should understand the basics of the algorithm, how it works, and
importantly, what are the underlying assumptions.

For this reason, we will implement most of the methods here from
scratch, first, before moving onto any libraries.

### Programming experience


The second goal of this class is to get everyone more comfortable
with programming, so you should ask questions about programming as
they arise during the semester.

In this course, I will mostly use python, since it makes interactive 
coding during the lectures a lot easier.

```{note}
You are however free to use whichever programming language you are
most comfortable with for the homework/project.  I will do interactive
demonstrations primarily in python but we encourage you to
try out a new language (e.g. Julia, C/C++) if you are already very comfortable
in python .
